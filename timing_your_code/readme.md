-> Timing your solution is really helpful when you want to figure out the fastest solution amongst the multiple solutions of the same problem
-> By timing your code performance
-> We will learn three ways of doing this 
    1) Simply tracking time elapsed(sometimes can't show dif if there is smaller dif and on smaller date can show exact same elapsed time so precision is low in time because of which timeit is more reliable)
    2) Using the timeit module
    3) Special %%timeit "magic" for Jupyter Notebooks(not needed for me)
